# Opening the Black Box: Interpreting Deep Hedging Policies via Symbolic Regression

The hedging of financial derivatives in markets characterized by stochastic volatility presents a significant challenge to traditional parametric models. This term paper investigates the Deep Hedging approach, which consists of application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the hedging of at-the-money call options, in particular utilizing the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. We train the agent in two distinct environments: a controlled Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) setting and a realistic Heston Stochastic Volatility setting calibrated to S\&P 500 data. Our results demonstrate that in the constant-volatility regime, the DRL agent autonomously recovers the Black-Scholes hedging strategy without prior theoretical knowledge. In the stochastic volatility environment, the agent consistently outperforms the Black-Scholes benchmark, achieving lower portfolio variance and superior risk-adjusted returns. A key contribution of this work is the application of Symbolic Regression to interpret the "black-box" neural network policies. We find that the agent learns a closed-form hedging rule that structurally resembles the Black-Scholes delta but incorporates specific corrections for the leverage effect and fat-tailed return distributions. These findings suggest that Deep Hedging can effectively internalize complex market dynamics, and Symbolic Regression serves as a powerful tool for bridging the gap between machine learning performance and economic interpretability.
